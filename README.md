# calculadora_vue

This repository contains my school project for EBAC (Escola Brit√¢nica de Artes Criativas), where I built a simple calculator using Vue.js. This project was created as a part of my learning journey to understand the fundamentals of Vue.js and how to create interactive web applications.

## Project Overview

In this project, I designed and implemented a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface and displays the input and results dynamically. It's a great starting point for anyone looking to explore Vue.js for web development.

## Technologies Used

Vue.js: I used Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework, to build the calculator's frontend components and handle the dynamic updates of the user interface.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Dynamic display of input and result.
- Operation select button.
- User-friendly and responsive design.

## Usage

- Enter numbers using the inputs.
- Select the desired operators using the selection box.
- Delete the value on the input to clear the operation and start over.
- Change the operation icon to try different results.

## Contribution

Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you have any suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes to share.

### Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the EBAC community for their support and guidance throughout this project. This calculator was created as a part of my learning journey in Vue.js, and I hope it serves as a helpful resource for others exploring this technology.
